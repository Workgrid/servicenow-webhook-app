# Development Process

All code intended for production use must:

1. Be introduced as a pull request targeting the `main` branch.
2. All pull requests must have a reference to the internal change management ticket by including it in the pull request title or description (e.g. ETSWORK-####)
3. All code must be approved by at least two reviewers as well as any defined [code owners](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-code-owners) in accordance with our internally documented code review guidelines
  1. At least one code reviewer should determine if the code change matches the intent of the change management ticket.
4. All required checks must pass before a pull request can be merged. These are automated through GitHub Actions.
